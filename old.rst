Where linux based robots have been, before my background.  

need summary of what I"m going to say
Where it was
Where it is
Where it's going


Setup my background with summary of the Grand Challenge
Ask who knows about it?  Who was involved with it.  ->>> This is what I did.  

Connect East Palo Alto to West Philly


Tools need more transitions, showing ROS log in the corner, --- Use ROS logo for where we are today. Connect with Willow Garage and our current mission.  
Use Scott's history of open source -> WG Mission for robotics.  



Transitions - wrap up previous and lead into the next point
Finding ways to enguage with the audience - ask more questions, even retorical

More direct conneciton to linux lost from last draft.



ENERGY!!!!!!!
