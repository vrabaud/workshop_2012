                               - Reduce 
                               - Reuse
                               - Recycle
============================== ==========================

.. TODO fixme get this table working well 

.. note:: You can take the 3 tenants of recycling and directly apply them here. 
   The goal is to reduce wasted effort and make people more productive.  
   Reduce the amount of code written. 
   Reuse existing code, don't reimplement it if someone's already done it
   Recycle -- take parts of existing code and reuse them


.. note:: Values -- less volume + more eyes -> higher code quality, no duplicated effort.

.. note:: TRANSITION: The way to do this effectively is to collaborate better.

   Computer industry is booming, and alot of it is due to the
   availability of open source software in particular linux.  We're
   looking to kick start the robotics industry in the same way.
