.. note::

   To give you a sense of motivation I'm going to give you a bit of my background.

.. note:: 

   Connect with audience!!! Ask how many know of Grand Challenge? HOw many particpiated? 
   What is the grand challenge?

.. note::

   Explain Grand Challenge: Tony Tether's vision.  Cost of contracting
   with defence firms, lack of promise.
   - Leverage prize money.  -- Administration was much more than the prize money.

   Dell Gentoo/Slackware RTAI Servers with Fedora desktop
   IBM Servers with Slackware installation
   Mac Mini's with Ubuntu and Matlab

.. note::

   Possible story about Distance that Bob Traveled, barbed wire issue.  

   Possible story about Alice failure, combined laser failures, with GPS outage, and stopping to reset while under power lines and a bug in the resume code. 

   Possible story about Little Ben mac minis and sensors being removed due to parking in West Philly, compare to East Palo Alto, Compton

.. note:: DARPA Urban Grand Challenge

.. Little Ben + Junior
.. image:: images/urban_challenge.jpg

.. note::
   Why did DARPA choose the challenge format? -- because paying military contractors to do this is much less efficient than crowd sourcing.  

.. note:: Note the similarities between these two cars.  The code
   which defined the difference between the winning car and the other
   finalists was maybe 10 percent of the effort.  The other 90% of the
   efforts could have been shared and not given up their competitive
   advantage.  And think if the 100+ teams in the overall competition
   had all contributed just a little bit to a shared pool.  
   Of course I'm preaching to the choir.


.. note:: This is indicative of the state of academic robotics in general.

                               - Reduce 
                               - Reuse
                               - Recycle
============================== ==========================

.. TODO fixme get this table working well 

.. note:: You can take the 3 tenants of recycling and directly apply them here. 
   The goal is to reduce wasted effort and make people more productive.  
   Reduce the amount of code written. 
   Reuse existing code, don't reimplement it if someone's already done it
   Recycle -- take parts of existing code and reuse them


.. note:: Values -- less volume + more eyes -> higher code quality, no duplicated effort.

.. note:: TRANSITION: The way to do this effectively is to collaborate better.

.. note:: 
   
   Computer industry is booming, and alot of it is due to the
   availability of open source software in particular linux.  We're
   looking to kick start the robotics industry in the same way.
