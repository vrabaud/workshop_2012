.. note:: 

   We're growing the community and now we're planning to start pushing
   our more mature code upstream to ubuntu and fedora repos.  Toward
   growing the community we are also now reaching out to more people
   by pushing our software onto smaller platforms.  We have many
   people starting to use ROS on Android and Arm based computer.  We
   just launched the TurtleBot running on Atom based laptops.

.. note:: Introduce Turtlebot, getting from research into the home
   Small platform, give people access to the ROS community in a
   package they can take home.

.. note::
   Don't spend too long, talk more after video.

.. note:: 
   Computer are great, they can display things, but what would you want them to do if they could move?   

   Who thinks they have the hardware to user robot code?
   Who has a computer and a webcam?  Who has a Kinect?  
   Simulator?  
   Rovio, roomba.
