What is a personal robot?


.. note::
   Seek audiance input/suggestions.

   In the real world.  iRobot Create,

   But what robots do we have in the home.

.. note:: We have simple cleaning robots.  They sometimes can work on
   their own, sometimes they're more entertainment.

.. note:: And we have many robots companions, but the extent of their 
   abilities is to make noises and wiggle a little.

DARPA Urban Grand Challenge

.. image:: images/urban_challenge.jpg

.. note:: Note the similarities between these two cars.  The code
   which defined the difference between the winning car and the other
   finalists was maybe 10 percent of the effort.  The other 90% of the
   efforts could have been shared and not given up their competitive
   advantage.  And think if the 100+ teams in the overall competition
   had all contributed just a little bit to a shared pool.  
   Of course I'm preaching to the choir.


.. note:: This is indicative of the state of academic robotics in general.  
   TRANSITION TO PHD COMIC

============================== =========

                                - Reuse
                                - Recycle
============================== =========

 TODO fixme get this table working well 

.. note:: You can take the 3 tenants of recycling and directly apply them here. 
   The goal is to reduce wasted effort and make people more productive.  
   Reduce the amount of code written. 
   Reuse existing code, don't reimplement it if someone's already done it
   Recycle -- take parts of existing code and reuse them


.. note:: Values -- less volume + more eyes -> higher code quality, no duplicated effort.

Worldwide community
-------------------
.. image:: images/ros_map.png
   :width: 1024

.. note:: 

   This represents the locations of most of the public repositories
   which are releaseing open source code and we are indexing.

Future Plans
------------

.. note:: 

   We're growing the community and now we're planning to start pushing
   our more mature code upstream to ubuntu and fedora repos.

.. The TurtleBot

.. image:: images/turtlebot.jpg

Live Demo!

.. note:: Introduce Turtlebot, getting from research into the home
   Small platform, give people access to the ROS community in a
   package they can take home.
   
.. note:: Show off teleo interactive markers, 2dnavigation + prebuilt
   slam from before hand.  Then stop it and switch to teleop android.
